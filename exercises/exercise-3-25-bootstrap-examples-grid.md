# Exercise 3-25

In this exercise, you will modify the home page in the `bootstrap-examples` project to be responsive to different device sizes.

## Bootstrap Grid System

1.  **Open** the folder named `bootstrap-examples`
in Visual Studio Code.
1. Create a `<header>` for the home page (`index.html`). Display the text "Bootstrap Examples" in the header.
1. Use an HTML5 `<nav>` element to display an an anchor with the text "Home" that takes you back to the same page (index.html).
1. Create a `<main>`element. This main will contain 3 paragraphs of lorem ipsum text that should appear side-by-side on medium (md) devices and above. To do this, you will need to use the Bootstrap grid system.
1. Test your page and work out the kinks.
1. After your page looks okay on a full screen browser, resize the browser to be narrow and watch the paragraphs "stack" within a smaller display area.
