# Exercise 3-16

In this exercise, you create a `bootstrap-examples` project and configure a home page to use Bootstrap. It is step 1 for other exercises in this module.

## Setting up Bootstrap

1.  Create a folder named `bootstrap-examples`.
1.  **Open** the **folder** in Visual Studio Code.
1.  Create three folders:

    - css
    - images
    - scripts
      > You will leave them empty for now.

1.  Create the file `bootstrap-examples\index.html`.

    > Files at this level are referred to as being at the root of the project (folder).

1.  In `index.html`, create the standard HTML layout including `DOCTYPE`, `html`, `head` and `body` elements.

    > HINT: Use emmet to do the work for you

1.  Add the meta tags that Bootstrap expects. Then include the `Bootstrap 5.2` framework's `CSS` and `JS` files from a CDN.
1.  Add an `h1` and a `paragraph` to the `index.html` page.
1.  Test the page to verify that the bootstrap stylesheet changed the look of the page.
1.  [Download Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/) and include the files in the `css` and `scripts` folders respectively.
1.  Update the stylesheet link and script in `index.html` to point to the Bootstrap files you downloaded in the last step.
1.  Test the page to verify it still looks the same.
1.  Test that you can peek at your styles and the class names from Bootstrap autocomplete now that the files are in your project.

    > You will need these two Visual Studio code extensions installed for this to work properly.

        CSS Peek
        HTML CSS Support

    [Details on how to do install the extensions are here](../setup/vscode-config.md).
