# Exercise 2-21

## City Site Styling

Revisit your `city-site` project. We are going to add some styling rules to your site.

1. Create a folder for your project named `city-site`.
1. In your `css` folder, add an external style sheet named `styles.css`.
1. Link to the external stylesheet `styles.css` in the `index.html` page so the styles will be applied to the HTML elements on the page.
1. Using an `element` selector, create a ` CSS rule` that applies to all `paragraphs`. In it, set the font-family to one of the ones from: [W3 Schools Websafe Fonts List](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp). Make sure to include the fallback font of either serif on sans-serif.
1. Test your page, verify the style changed the appearance of the page.
1. Using a `class` selector, create a CSS rule that will be applied to the HTML `table`. Place a border around the HTML table and its cells. If you aren't sure how, refer to [W3 School's CSS Tables Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp). Apply that class to the HTML table on the index page.
1. Test your page again to verify it is working.
