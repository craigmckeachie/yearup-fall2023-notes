1. Add the boilerplate tags needed for every HTML page.

1. Add a header with navigation links to both pages. See the mockup provided below.

   > The header code will be nearly the same if not the same on both pages.

   > Make sure to use HTML5 semantic elements

1. Design the index.html (home) page following the mockup provided below.

   > Warning: Because we are not doing any CSS styling yet the pages will not look exactly like these mockups but all the html elements should be there so we can later style them.
