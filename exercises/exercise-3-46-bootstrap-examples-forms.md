# Exercise 3-38

In this exercise, you will add a form to the `bootstrap-examples` project.

## Bootstrap Forms

1.  **Open** the folder named `bootstrap-examples`
    in Visual Studio Code.
1.  Create a new page named signin.html. Make sure to add support for Bootstrap.

1.  Now, do some Googling and find a signin (login) form example that is styled using Bootstrap. Copy the code to your page.

    > The [examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/) page in the Boostrap documentation has a good one. Click the download examples button to easily see the code.

1.  Make changes as needed to make the page "fit in" with your needs.
1.  View the page.
1.  In `index.html`, add a second link near the `Home` link that allows a user to navigate to your `signin` page.
1.  Test the link.
